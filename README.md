# Finance Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project is designed to monitor and assess the bank’s lending activities and performance. It provides insights into key loan-related metrics and trends over time, enabling data-driven decision-making and evaluation of the bank’s loan portfolio health. The report will help track applications, funding, repayments, and borrower profiles, aiding the bank in optimizing its lending strategies.

## Problem Statement

1. **Tracking Loan Applications and Fund Disbursements**: The bank needs to monitor the total number of loan applications and the total amount of loans funded. Month-to-Month (MoM) and Month-to-Date (MTD) tracking are essential to observe lending performance over time.
2. **Assessing Cash Flow**: Monitoring the total amount received from borrowers is critical for understanding cash flow and the repayment status of loans.
3. **Monitoring Interest Rates**: It is necessary to calculate and track the average interest rates applied across all loans, observing MoM fluctuations to manage loan costs.
4. **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: The bank must track the average debt-to-income (DTI) ratio for borrowers, as it directly impacts borrowers' ability to repay loans.
5. **Understanding Loan Trends by Region**: The bank wants to assess how loan applications and funding amounts vary by geographic location, identifying areas of high or low lending activity.
6. **Analyzing Borrower Profiles**: The bank should understand loan distributions based on borrower profiles, such as employment length, home ownership status, and loan purpose (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card refinancing).
7. **Loan Purpose**: The bank needs insights into the reasons borrowers apply for loans, and how different purposes impact loan performance and repayment rates.
